## Presentation

GroovOliou is a VST3 plugin for MacOS developed with the [JUCE framework](https://docs.juce.com/master/tutorial_create_projucer_basic_plugin.html).

The goal was to create a simple drum sample player that would ease the browsing process to select samples.
The UI offers dedicated buttons to load directly the following/previous sample located under the same folder, instead of having to open the navigation menu every time.

It also offers the following features:
- Attack
- Decay
- Play order
- Pitch
- Balance
- Gain
- Multiple outputs
