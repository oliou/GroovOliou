## Presentation

GroovOliou is a VST3 plugin for MacOS developed with the [JUCE framework](https://docs.juce.com/master/tutorial_create_projucer_basic_plugin.html).

The goal was to create a simple drum sample player that would easily browse across long list of samples.
The UI offers dedicated buttons to load directly the next/previous sample located under the same folder, instead of having to open the navigation menu every time to change the sample.

It also offers the following features:
- Sample start trim
- release
- Play modes (Note On/Off or One-shot)
- Reverse Playback
- Pitch
- Balance
- Gain
- Multiple outputs
